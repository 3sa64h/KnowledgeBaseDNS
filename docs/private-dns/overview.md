### What is Private AdGuard DNS

Private AdGuard DNS is a DNS server that, in addition to benefits of a public DNS server (such as traffic encryption and domain blocklists), provides features like flexible customization, DNS statistics and parental control and is easily managed through a handy dashboard.

### How Private AdGuard DNS came to be

Today, you can connect anything to the Internet: TVs, refrigerators, smart bulbs, or speakers. But along with the undeniable conveniences you get trackers and ads. A simple browser-based ad blocker will not protect you in this case, but AdGuard DNS, which you can set up to filter traffic, block content and trackers, can help.

Earlier, we were able to offer either a public AdGuard DNS server or AdGuard Home for "cleaning up the Internet". These solutions worked for some users, but for many of them, the public AdGuard DNS lacked the flexibility of configuration, while the AdGuard Home lacked simplicity. We can say that private AdGuard DNS appeared at the meeting point of these two products and took only the best features from both of them.

### The difference between Private and Public AdGuard DNS

Here is a simple sum up of differences in available features between Public AdGuard DNS and Private AdGuard DNS servers.

| Public AdGuard DNS  | Private AdGuard DNS |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| DNS traffic encryption      | DNS traffic encryption       |
| Pre-determined domain blocklists      | Customizable domain blocklists      |
| -   | Custom DNS filtering rules with import/export feature
| -   | Request statistics (see where do your DNS requests go: which countries, which companies etc.)        |
| -   | Detailed query log |
| -   | Parental control       |

### Private AdGuard DNS features

**Blocklists management**

With the private DNS server, you'll be able to set which domains you want to block and which you don't. This will work the same way as the public AdGuard DNS, but with one change: now it's your decision, not AdGuard's.

**Import/export custom rules**

For those who aren't satisfied with dozens of pre-installed *Blocklists* with thousands of rules, we've provided a handy function to import custom rules. If you have a list of [DNS filtering rules](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/dns-filtering-syntax), you can upload it to the service and activate it. Here you can also manually enter custom rules and export the list.

**Advanced statistics**

There are a lot of things in life we can't control, but fortunately, this doesn't apply to DNS queries made by devices connected to private AdGuard  DNS. You can see the total number and geography of requests, the number of blocked requests and a list of companies the requests were addressed to both in the summary table and in separate tabs with detailed statistical information.

**Parental control**

To protect your child from online content you deem inappropriate, set up and activate the *Parental control* option. In addition to options such as "adult content" blocking and safe search, we've added the ability to manually specify domains for blocking and set a schedule for the *Parental control* to work accordingly.
