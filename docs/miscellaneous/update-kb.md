The goal of this Knowledge Base is to provide everyone with the most up-to-date information on all kinds of AdGuard DNS-related topics. But things constantly change, and sometimes an article doesn't reflect the current state of things anymore — there are simply not so many of us to keep an eye on every single bit of information and update it accordingly when new versions are released. 

This is why we placed all of our KB content to [GitHub](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/KnowledgeBaseDNS), and now literally anyone can contribute to it by suggesting edits and translations to existing articles, as well as totally new ones. 

## How to suggest a change or write a new article 
 
You can suggest changes to current articles and add new ones to the Knowledge Base DNS using the functionality of the GitHub mentioned above.
If you are unfamiliar with principles of working with the platform, start by reading [documentation in this section](https://docs.github.com/en).

The Knowledge Base DNS website is buit using Docusaurus 2 — a modern static website generator. When suggesting changes or additions, take into account that all documents must comply with the principles of the platform. You can read about them in [the guide available via this link](https://docusaurus.io/docs/category/guides).

You can use Docusaurus functionality to build a site from documents placed locally on your computer. Detailed instructions on how to do this can be found [here](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/KnowledgeBaseDNS/blob/main/README.md). 
 
Once you are ready to start, work in [the KnowledgeBaseDNS repository](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/KnowledgeBaseDNS). All texts in our Knowledge Base DNS are written in `Markdown` markup language. Keep this in mind when editing or writing articles. Follow [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to learn more about Markdown syntax.

## Translating an article

Translation of the existing articles of the Knowledge Base DNS is carried out on [the Crowdin platform](https://crowdin.com/project/adguard-knowledge-bases). If this site is unfamiliar to you and you are not registered on it, [go to this article](/miscellaneous/adguard-translations/translate-adguard-dns.md) for more information on the topic. 

## Working on open issues

Sometimes there exist [open tasks](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/KnowledgeBaseDNS/issues/) related to updating the Knowledge Base. You can help us speed up their completion [the same way](#how-to-suggest-a-change-or-write-a-new-article) you would suggest any other changes to this Knowledge Base. Choose any issue that you find appealing and start working on it. If you have any questions — you can ask them right in the comments to that issue.
