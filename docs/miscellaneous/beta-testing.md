The open beta testing phase of private AdGuard DNS started not so long ago. And now we especially need your participation in the development of the product. Join the AdGuard team and become a private AdGuard DNS beta tester. How can you do it?

## How to become a beta tester

Becoming a private AdGuard DNS beta tester has never been easier! You just need to [go to the AdGuard DNS website](https://adguard-dns.io/en/welcome.html), click the 'Join beta' button in the upper right corner, sign in through social media or an existing AdGuard account. That's it: now you can set up your private AdGuard DNS, use the service and send us reports on how it works.

## How to report a bug

Let’s imagine it happened — you spotted a bug. Or maybe you just want to share your suggestion with developers? Anyway, there are several ways to let us know:

* Go to [forum.adguard.com](forum.adguard.com) and post there a new thread (or find an existing one) in the beta forum [category](https://forum.adguard.com/index.php?categories/48/). Make sure to read [forum rules](https://forum.adguard.com/index.php?threads/14859/) first;

* Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/) and find a suitable repository. Create a new issue there and describe the bug/feature request in detail.

The above two methods are the most preferred, but you can use others if necessary:

* Find us on various social media platforms, like [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AdguardEn/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adguard/), etc. However, this is not the most convenient way to discuss technical matters.

* Email our support team from the Support tab in the app or write directly to [support@adguard.com](mailto:support@adguard.com).

## What else?

There is not much more to add. You don't have to go out of your way to find bugs. You can continue using AdGuard DNS as usual. And in case you encounter a problem, be sure to let us know about it!
