Private AdGuard DNS is the youngest AdGuard product, even though it is in some ways a logical continuation of the idea of [AdGuard Home](https://kb.adguard.com/en/home/overview). With every new version we try to make Private AdGuard DNS better. And on our way to perfection we really need the help of beta testers. Join our team!

## How to become a beta tester

To become a beta tester of Private AdGuard DNS [go to the AdGuard DNS website](https://adguard-dns.io/en/welcome.html), click the 'Join beta' button in the upper right corner, sign in through social media or an existing AdGuard account. That's it: now you can set up your Pivate AdGuard DNS, use the service and send us reports on how it works.

## How to report a bug

Let’s imagine it happened — you spotted a bug. Or maybe you just want to share your suggestion with developers? Anyway, there are several ways to let us know:

* Go to [forum.adguard.com](forum.adguard.com) and post there a new thread (or find an existing one) in [the 'Beta Testing' category of the forum](https://forum.adguard.com/index.php?categories/48/). Make sure to read [forum rules](https://forum.adguard.com/index.php?threads/14859/) first;

* Go to [the AdGuard DNS repository](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS), create a new issue there and describe the bug/feature request in detail.

The above methods are the most preferred, but you can use others if necessary:

* Find us on various social media platforms, like [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AdguardEn/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adguard/), etc. However, this is not the most efficient way to discuss technical matters.

* Email our support team from the Support tab in the app or write directly to [support@adguard.com](mailto:support@adguard.com).
